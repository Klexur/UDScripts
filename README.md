These are my userscripts for the browser-based zombie apocalypse MMORPG, [Urban Dead](http://www.urbandead.com).

## How to use
You must have the Greasemonky addon for Firefox installed, or a browser that is natively compatible with userscripts.

## The scripts

### UD Map Skinner
Applies images from the original Firefox addon, UDToolbar, to the in-game map.

As there were not images for all building types created, some will have to be reused as substitutes.

### UD PK Reporter
My attempt to automate the task of reporting player kills (PKs) to the [Rogues Gallery](http://rg.urbandead.net).

Actions:

1.    Submit page to Dumbwit to generate link.
2.    Grab witness link and navigate to the Rogues Gallery upload page.
3.    Enter link into upload box.
